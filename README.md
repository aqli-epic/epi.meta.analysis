# Epidemiological Studies: Meta Analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This analysis is our ongoing attempt to capture all epidemiological
research studies (\>1000 people; max sample size: 1380 million), that
are relatively long term (\> 1 year(s), max study duration: 36 years)
and measure the impact of **ambient** PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>,
TSP, Ultra Fine Particulate Matter on Mortality (cause-specific, all
cause, premature)/Life Expectancy published between 1993 and present\*,
findable in available peer-reviewed literature. Hereafter, we refer to
these studies as **“AQ epi studies”** for short. As of now, this
meta-analysis analyzes 88 AQ epi studies. This analysis will be
continually updated to incorporate new AQ epi studies.

We are seeking to make this analysis as current, complete and error-free
as possible and view it as a continual work in progress. We would
appreciate the air quality community’s comments, corrections, and
suggestions. Please contact **<aqli-epic@uchicago.edu>** or leave a
comment in [this](https://github.com/aqli-epic/epi.meta.analysis) GitHub

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the landscape of
epidemiological research on the relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub>,
PM<sub>10</sub>, TSP, Ultrafine Particulate Matter and Mortality (all
types, as specified above)/Life Expectancy and to surface demographic,
geographic, or other trends that may exist in the current state of
literature. While the overall arc of the relationship between these
pollutants and human health is clear enough to take action,
understanding such trends can help the field reflect on itself, take
stock of any biases or gaps – and point toward future research and
policy opportunities.

## Why do epidemiological studies on air pollution and mortality matter?

While global estimates of air pollution’s toll on public health vary,
they all point in the same direction: air pollution poses one of the
largest health risks on the planet to humans
\[[Paper1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1300018110),
[Paper2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1616784114),
[Paper3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b00360),
[Paper4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b00360)\].
Epidemiological studies on air pollution and mortality help us
understand the burden of air pollution on human health at global,
national and regional levels. According to [Vahlsing and Smith
(2012)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11869-010-0131-2.pdf),
these sorts of studies can also help countries take policy action,
pushing forward and shaping national-level ambient air quality
standards.

The burden of air pollution across the world is also not uniform. While
98.2 percent of the world population is out of compliance with the
latest WHO annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> guideline of 5 µg/m³, there is huge
variation in the quality of air one breathes.

## Results

 

### PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration range and the Global Population Distribution

 

<img src="man/figures/README-mean_pm2.5_population_graph_calcs-1.png" width="100%" /><img src="man/figures/README-mean_pm2.5_population_graph_calcs-2.png" width="100%" />

 

- In total 88 AQ epi studies were included in the final [analysis
  dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AljEJhNPLWX_8xRbT_HJuERBpbQt_QGixgJ9jEzFyQw/edit#gid=2082201996).
  Of these, 77 were PM<sub>2.5</sub> specific. Others (11 studies) are
  multi-pollutant studies.

- 12.7 percent of the world population, or 980.7 million people, live in
  areas where the annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution is greater
  than 50 µg/m³. But, only 9.1 percent (7 PM<sub>2.5</sub> specific
  studies) of the total PM<sub>2.5</sub> studies, have been performed in
  these highly polluted parts of the world. These highly polluted areas
  are areas where the average PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution is at least 10
  times the WHO PM<sub>2.5</sub> safe guideline of 5 µg/m³.

- Approximately 5.9 percent of the world population (458.3 million
  people) live in the most severely polluted parts of the world, where
  annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution is upwards of 75 µg/m³ (at
  least 15 times the WHO safe guideline). In these most severely
  polluted parts of the world, 0 PM<sub>2.5</sub> AQ epi studies have
  been performed .

- Most of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> AQ epi studies (68.8 percent of the total
  number of PM<sub>2.5</sub> studies, or 53 studies) performed so far,
  are concentrated in areas where the average PM<sub>2.5</sub>
  concentration is in the 0-25 µg/m³ range. People living in these areas
  (58.2 percent of the world population) are breathing air that is much
  less polluted relative to the people living in the most polluted parts
  of the world (as seen above). But, even in the 0-25 µg/m³ bucket,
  anyone living above 5 µg/m³, is out of compliance with the WHO
  PM<sub>2.5</sub> guideline.

### Geographic Distribution of Studies

<img src="man/figures/README-geographic_dist_studies_calcs-1.png" width="100%" />

- 55.7 percent of all AQ epi studies (49 studies) included in this
  analysis included populations in either the US or Canada or both.

- USA, Canada and Europe (or some combination of them) were focus
  countries in 72.7 percent of all AQ epi studies (64 studies). Other
  countrie(s) that have been included in an AQ epi study: China, Japan,
  Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, South Korea.

- Of the total number of times a given continent’s population has been
  included in any given AQ epi study, North America dominates the rest
  of the continents and has been included 55.7 percent of times (all due
  to studies in the US or Canada). Closely following North America,
  populations in Asia and Europe have been included in AQ epi studies
  27.3 and 17 percent of times respectively. Africa, South America,
  Oceania have seen 0 long term (\> 1 year), large (\>1000 people in the
  sample) AQ epi study.

### AQ Epi studies over time

 

<img src="man/figures/README-aq_epi_studies_over_time_graph-1.png" width="100%" />

- In most of the 90’s and early 2000’s, the rate of AQ epi studies
  publishing was around 1 to 2 studies per annum on average.

  - Post 2009, there has been a noticeable increase in the overall
    volume of AQ epi studies published.

 

<hr>

### Distribution of duration of study by continent

<img src="man/figures/README-dist_duration_study_calcs-1.png" width="100%" />

- In total, 8 “really” long term studies (\> 25 years) have been
  performed. That is, 9.1 percent of the total number of studies.

- All of the following continents have seen at least 1 really long term
  study: North America, Europe.

- All of the following continents have seen more than 1 really long term
  study: North America.

- In all of the really long term studies (including both
  multi-country/continent and single-country), i.e. ones that have a
  study duration of \> 25 years - North America was included 7 times in
  those studies (87.5 percent of the total number of times any given
  continent is included in any given study).

- Similarly, Europe has been included 1 times in such long term studies
  (12.5 percent of the total number of times any given continent is
  included in any given study).

## Conclusion

All studies included in this analysis point to the same overall
picture:air pollution is a serious health threat. The existing state of
scientific literature on air pollution and health is clear that air
pollution’s impact on health is well-established and taking action to
improve a polluted environment should not be delayed in order to
complete multi-year large sample (\> 1000) epidemiological studies in an
area, even if there has not been a prior study in that particular
geography. That said, it is important for the field of air quality
epidemiolgy to understand the contours of its current research landscape
to most effectively identify directions for future research and deploy
limited resources.

 

## Methodology

Through a comprehensive and ongoing\* literature review, we are making
an attempt at creating an exhaustive public listing of all the
epidemiological studies out there (that we could find) that examine the
relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and Life Expectancy/Mortality.

For each study, we record data on key defining features, such as:
Geography, Sample Size, Study Duration, PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure range,
etc. Then we used
[this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AljEJhNPLWX_8xRbT_HJuERBpbQt_QGixgJ9jEzFyQw/edit#gid=2082201996)
analysis dataset to carry out a meta-analysis, results of which are
detailed in the Results section above.

We are seeking to make this analysis as current, complete and error-free
as possible and view it as a continual work in progress. We would
welcome the air quality community’s any comments, corrections, andor
suggestions. Please contact **<aqli-epic@uchicago.edu>** or leave a
comment in this GitHub repository.

 

## Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for studies

- The underlying [****analysis
  dataset****](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AljEJhNPLWX_8xRbT_HJuERBpbQt_QGixgJ9jEzFyQw/edit#gid=2082201996)
  for this meta analysis focuses only on those papers that study the
  link between **PM<sub>2.5</sub>**, **PM<sub>10</sub>**, **TSP**,
  **Fine Particulate Matter** and ****Mortality/Life Expectancy****. In
  addition to the analysis dataset, there is a [****master
  dataset****](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AljEJhNPLWX_8xRbT_HJuERBpbQt_QGixgJ9jEzFyQw/edit#gid=0)
  that expands on the analysis dataset to include other useful
  information. The idea behind the master dataset is to record any
  additional details (whether additional facts about the paper, or
  details on other pollutants studied in the paper) that will not be a
  part of the main data analysis exercise. Master dataset will also list
  additional papers that do not fit into the inclusion criteria.

- The analysis dataset excludes the following types of papers:
  meta-analysis, unpublished papers, papers studying the effects of
  indoor air pollution on Mortality/Life Expectancy, papers forecasting
  future air pollution/life expectancy/mortality. But, the master
  dataset lists all of these studies.

- In Multi-Country (pooled) studies, one entry (one row in the analysis
  dataset) is recorded for each country in papers where country level
  data is available. There are some pooled studies where country level
  data is not available, but rather data is available for a custom
  region (e.g. South-East Asia), such pooled studies are excluded from
  the analysis dataset. But, the master dataset still lists all of these
  additional studies for reference.

- In cases where the same cohort is studied by different research groups
  at different points in time/using different methods: we have included
  and counted all of those studies as separate unique studies in the
  analysis below.

- Papers studying the health effects of pollution segregated by sectors
  (source apportionment type studies), regions (example, Rural v/s
  Urban), season (Winter v/s Summer) are excluded from this analysis.

- Papers that include combined estimates of Household and Ambient Air
  Pollution, but not individual estimates are excluded.

- All papers studying the impact of pollutants on DALY’s (Disability
  Adjusted Life Years), are excluded from this analysis.

 

## Other important points

- In papers, where the minimum PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was not
  reported, we have assumed the lowest available percentile data
  available on PM2.5 concentration as the minimum concentration.

- In many papers, only one of the mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> or
  PM<sub>2.5</sub> range is reported but not both. In these cases,
  wherever the data is not available (whether it is mean
  PM<sub>2.5</sub> or PM<sub>2.5</sub> range) we have recorded the
  instances as “NA”. Apart from this, anywhere we couldn’t find data, we
  have recorded it as “NA”. **This is one of the limitations of this
  analysis**.

- Different papers talk about different types of mean PM<sub>2.5</sub>
  values. Some report daily averages, while others may report
  monthly/annual averages. Also, in some cases, the averages are
  population weighted and in other cases they are not. But, it is not
  always clearly stated as to which type of average the paper is
  referring to (or how it was calculated). In scenarios like these, we
  had to make a value judgement and **this is one of the limitations of
  this analysis.**

- In cases, where mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> is reported for both the **start
  year** and the **end year**(or also for sometime between a start year
  and the end year) of the study, we have reported the **end year** mean
  PM<sub>2.5</sub> value.

- Papers that have used a conversion factor to convert mean
  PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations to mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations
  are included but, there PM<sub>2.5</sub> values (mean, lower limit,
  upper limit, standard deviation) is not recorded.

- In multi-pollutant studies where different pollutants have been
  studied over different periods of time, we have chosen the specific
  time period that corresponds to the PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollutant (in
  cases where we PM<sub>2.5</sub> is not present, we have recorded the
  time period corresponding to one of the other pollutants).

- We have recorded one mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> value for each paper. But,
  there are papers where more than one mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> value is
  reported (for example, one for the male group and one for the female
  group). In these cases, we have picked one value from the ones that
  are available.

- In some papers, the exact start and/or end year of a study is unclear.
  In these cases, we have mostly chosen the first instance of the
  multiple “study duration ranges” (depending on multiple plausible
  interpretations of when the final follow up ended) the paper.

- In many papers, the upper limit or lower limit for age is not
  precisely specified. In these cases, we have recorded a NA. For
  example, there are papers where the upper limit category for age is
  85+. In these cases, although we know the upper limit category, we
  still don’t know the upper limit of the age, which could be 90, 95,
  100, etc.

- In places, where the sample size is specifed in terms of “number of
  regions” (for example, 17 districts) and not “number of people”, we
  have recorded a NA in the cohort size column.

- Under the “methods” column (in the master dataset), we have only
  mentioned a subset of methods that were used to carry out different
  parts of the study. Authors may have used other methods than those
  mentioned in our meta analysis.

- Different graphs are generated using different subsets of the
  [analysis
  dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AljEJhNPLWX_8xRbT_HJuERBpbQt_QGixgJ9jEzFyQw/edit#gid=2082201996).
  Most of them are PM<sub>2.5</sub> specific (our main focus), others
  include all pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, TSP,
  Ultrafine Particles). The type of papers used to generate a given
  graph and other nuances for the graph in question are specified within
  the graph (as a note) and/or the accompanying text.
